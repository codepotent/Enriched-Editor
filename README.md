> The **Enriched Editor** plugin adds lots of additional options to the ClassicPress visual editor. This plugin is a fork of TinyMCE Advanced for WordPress and contains no Gutenberg code.

### Always use the **[latest release](https://github.com/codepotent/enriched-editor/releases/latest)** on production sites! 

_Branch downloads and clones are for development; not for general use._

### Pre-Installation
If you already have _TinyMCE Advanced_ or _WYWIWYG Advanced_ installed, you will need to deactivate and delete before installing _Enriched Editor_. If you want to preserve your current editor settings, you can export them to a text file before deleting the current plugin. You can then import those settings back into Enriched Editor after you get it installed.
